# flightpi

A spin-off of Matt Dyson's project, with updating the API Links and disabling the need for the Arduino and AdaFruit NeoPixels, utilising only the LCD Module. This file is from GalaxyTheoryz/flightpi. I just go head and fix some of the issues up. Such as a callsign "Test1234" begin stuck on the screen. In no way, I do take credit for any of this. I just fix like two lines of code, and a bit of the manual, to make it easier to understan.
